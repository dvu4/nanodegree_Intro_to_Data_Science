"""
In this optional exercise, you should complete the function called 
predictions(turnstile_weather). This function takes in our pandas 
turnstile weather dataframe, and returns a set of predicted ridership values,
based on the other information in the dataframe.  

You should attempt to implement another type of linear regression, 
that you may have read about, such as ordinary least squares regression: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares

This is your playground. Go wild!

How does your choice of linear regression compare to linear regression
with gradient descent?

You can look at the information contained in the turnstile_weather dataframe below:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

Note: due to the memory and CPU limitation of our amazon EC2 instance, we will
give you a random subset (~15%) of the data contained in turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are hitting 
the 30 second limit that's placed on running your program. See if you can optimize your code so it
runs faster.

    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~10%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this exercise on your own computer, locally. If you do, you may want to complete Exercise
    8 using gradient descent, or limit your number of features to 10 or so, since ordinary
    least squares can be very slow for a large number of features.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a
    smaller number of features.
